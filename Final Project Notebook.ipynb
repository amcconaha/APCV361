    "By evaluating these variables in conjunction with quality-of-life variables such as poor or fair health, poor physical health days, poor mental health days, and low birthweight and/or length of life variables such as premature death (years of potential life lost before age 75) it would paint a robust picture of any correlations in those areas. \n",
