 APCV361 project files

This is our final project for Professor Li Xu's APCV 361 course in Winter of 2023.

The Final Project Notebook is based off the information located in the project.csv based off the community data and documentation collected and developed by researchers at the University of  Wisconsin Population Health Institution.

Our Project Proposal will discuss everything that we plan to cover in our Final Project Notebook.

Thank you.
